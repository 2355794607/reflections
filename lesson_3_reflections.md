When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You can use a remote repository when you want to share your project with other developers and cooperate with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pulling changes allows you to determine when code is brought down. This means that code won't change unexpectedly without me knowing about it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: Make a copy of somebody else's repository directly on the GitHub servers.
    clone: Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it. The original repository could either be remote, or you could even clone a local repository into another spot on your computer.
    branch: Branches happen on a single repository. When you create one, you're creating it on one single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, I can update my local copy before I leave. I can do this even if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet. Then if I want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
